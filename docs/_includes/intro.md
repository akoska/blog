Hi, I am **Ákos Pintér** and I am a software engineer with more than 15 years experience. I live in Budapest, Hungary with my small family.

I work with various technologies on the full stack. Just some examples: backend (`nodejs`,`.NET Core`, `Python`), frontend (`React` + `Typescript`), Kubernetes (`k3s`), cloud (`AWS`, `DigitalOcean`), data (`Postgres`, `SQL Server`, `S3`, `DynamoDB`), auth (`OpenIdConnect`).

My primary focus is on building highly available and efficient systems hosted on Kubernetes or on a serverless option in the cloud.
